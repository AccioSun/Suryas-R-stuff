## Module 12

This module is about generating R Markdown documents.  Markdown is, essentially, a way of integrating code into text seamlessly with the option of exporting as HTML or Word documents.  

I can *add italics* **and other formatted text** to my words, or can add equations such as $A^{2} + B^{2} = C^{2}$. I can also add chunks of code, as shown below.  

```{r}
print("Hello World!")

```

Finally, I can, among other things:

 * create inline code such as `Freq <- c(0.6, 0.3, 0.4, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6, 0.3, 0.4, 0.9, 0.2)`
 
 * create plots and tables using Markdown
 
 * create lists
 
 * [create links](http://www.google.com)
 
 * create blockquotes
